<h2><strong>Purpose, Audience, Goal</strong></h2>
	<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This project is going to be used as a portfolio website with a focus on front-end development and deployment.</p>
	<p><strong>Audience:</strong> This site is mainly aimed towards possible recruiters, hiring managers, and other students.</p>
	<p><strong>Goal:</strong> The goal of this site is to showcase coding learned in the DeepDive Full-stack course to either be used as reference for students or for job applications and possible employers in the near future.</p>

<h3><strong>Persona</strong></h3>
	<p><strong>Name:</strong> Andreas Sanchez</p>
	<p><strong>Age:</strong> 31</p>
	<p><strong>Profession:</strong> Owns his own media and website development business and is looking for a part-time associate to help build a new website for a client. He has recently finished a job that allows him to hire on a new associate at above minimum wage to help with this high end client.</p>
	<p><strong>Technology:</strong> Windows power user. Andreas has 2 curved 27" Samsung 4k monitors with 144hz refresh rates. Andreas also has a custom built gaming pc with 32gb of ram, 10gb graphics card, i7-9700 series with 3.6ghz processing power. Avid iPhone user, has the iPhone 11 on a 4g data plan. Uses a small Alienware 14" laptop from time to time for small projects when he is visiting family.</p>
	<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviours:</strong> Very calm and relaxed boss. Easy going, but knows how to get things done during crunch-time. Andreas likes to see associates who are still in the beginning of their careers but are willing to learn on the fly and push themselves to do better. Andreas is an avid user of social media and checks each applicants profile accordingly to be sure that they would not misrepresent the company if hired. Being as it is a small start-up company, Andreas is testing the waters on multiple employees based on past references and LinkedIn profile accounts.</p>
	<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Andreas is looking to hire a new employee for this project. Looking for an associate with some form of experience, but is open to someone who has completed schooling in the subject and would like to gain more experience in the field of web-development. Looking for an associate to start at part-time entry level for the duration of the project, but may be willing to keep the associate on team if the experience was beneficial and they work well as a team. Frustrations that Andreas is having is being such a small company with a single employee, work is not always guaranteed, and being a small company means there are very few applicants that have applied for the position. The candidate pool is fairly small, and most of the applicants are just getting out of high school or a year of college and are under-qualified for his needs.</p>
	<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Andreas is trying to find the right fit for his small web-development company. Andreas wants to find someone who is not over-experienced, or under-experienced and would like to find a new associate who is willing to put in the hours to get the project completed and learn new habits and coding methods along the way. Andreas wants to complete this project before the due date to build a better reputation for future projects and future clients.</p>
	<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, I need to find a new entry-level associate to help with upcoming projects in a timely manner.</p>

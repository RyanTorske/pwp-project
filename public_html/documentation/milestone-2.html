<h1><strong>Ryan Torske Milestone 2 Content Strategy</strong></h1>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Welcome:</strong> This will be a basic welcome banner. Will have my full name printed out on it, will also have brief introduction
		to what I do starting with web development, then to Cook, then to DJ. Will likely have a design over the banner section,
		or a background photo of some form.</li>
	<li><strong>About Ryan:</strong> This section will explain more about me in detail. Going into the depths of what I have learned within the
		full-stack course, working in groups of people, and the overall way I handle my workflow. After this, I will explain my
		capacity with such things as computer rebuilding in my spare time, and music productions as one of my hobbies.</li>
	<li><strong>Projects:</strong> This section will go over the repositories and other projects that have been completed and stored within GitHub.
		WIll talk about personal projects I have undertaken outside of school, to better understand and learn information on Web Development.</li>
	<li><strong>Accomplishments:</strong> This section will be a little small compared to the others, but it will have details on previous work experience,
		and accomplishments in all my fields of study. It will have information about accomplishments in working as a team in a kitchen
		setting, and will also go over accomplishments in a managerial capacity. Finally I will go over my personal accomplishments with Web Development
		and team skills.</li>
	<li><strong>Education:</strong> This section should be bullet pointed and have information on both the Deep Dive Coding Boot-camp, my general studies, and my culinary studies.</li>
	<li><strong>Certificates:</strong> This section will cover basic certs I have achieved over the years such as A+ certification, Safety Certifications,
		and possibly network+ cert if finished before the project is ready for upload. After this course the Web Development Cert will also be included.</li>
	<li><strong>Contact Me:</strong> This will connect the user directly to my email account. Whether it be concerning a job application I had filed, or if it is a new
		cohort member needing advice in some form. Will also have a hot link to my LinkedIn account, my github repository page, and possibly a facebook
		business extension.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Mobile Device Strategy</strong></h1>
<ul>
	<li>This strategy for the layout on a mobile device is mainly being utilizing bootstrap and have the items on screen cascade into an even flow for viewing. After learning bootstrap, I now realize I can adjust it where pictures
	and text can be setup vertically and adjusted to better fit any screen size.</li>
</ul>

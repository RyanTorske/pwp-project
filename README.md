## Milestone 1 Feedback
* Great layout and styling!
* It is very clear that you thought out and researched each part of this. I like how much detail you put into each of the sections.
* According to the style guide the link to the stylesheet should go inside of the head tags. 
* Fantastic work! (:

## Milestone 2 Feedback
* Really nice desktop layout! Simple, clear and organized. Mobile wireframes could be optimized a little more. Instead of just being stretched and shrunk you could do some stacking similar to the bootstrap challenge.
* The info you plan to put in the content strategy is very detailed and complete, you could add a bit more detail to how you are going to display this info. Such as positioning on the page, any interactive features, maybe icons/logos to go with your certs.
* Try to commit a bit more, a good rule of thumb is every 15 mins or 15 lines of code.
* Clean code! Validation showed no errors, nice.

Overall nice work, could use a little refinement but totally solid project. The early turn in bumped you up a tier.
